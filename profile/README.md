# 🇫🇷 IA\_AUT\_ECO: The Augmented Autonomy Architecture (Open Source Deep Tech)

**IA\_AUT\_ECO** is a Deep Tech startup based near Paris, France, dedicated to redefining the use of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Robotics**. Our mission is to build robust, open-source solutions for the daily lives and autonomy of **disabled and invalid persons**.

We are building systems that guarantee **digital sovereignty**, **social inclusion**, and **uncompromising security**.

## 💡 Our Commitment: Open Source for All

We are firm believers that the most critical assistance technologies (AI, Robotics) must be **auditable and enduring**. Our architecture is designed on an ethical **Open Core** model: the technical foundations will eventually be made public to guarantee full trust and accountability.

* **The Core is Under Development:** Our open-source systems are currently in the initial design and hardening phase. We plan to open up the foundational repositories for community auditing and contributions at a later date.

## 🛡️ Uncompromising Security: A Sovereign Digital Shield

Trust is our currency. Our cybersecurity solutions are integrated by design, exceeding regulatory requirements.

### The Winterhold Foundational Architecture

The **Winterhold** ecosystem is our comprehensive offering, built upon several critical components, all currently under active development:

* **Hearthfire** 🔥: **The Hardened Security OS**. A core operating system (forked from FreeBSD) for local deployment and robotics, emphasizing Security by Design, Zéro Trust (ZTA), and PQC Readiness.
* **MASAQ** 🤖: **The AI Orchestrator**. Manages the secure and auditable execution of Deep Learning models, focusing on SLM optimization and Knowledge Graph management.
* **Ysgrammor** 👁️: **The Ethical Audit System**. Provides complete observability (OpenTelemetry) for all system actions and AI decisions, delivering **Proof of Intent** and ensuring NIS2 compliance.
* **Skald** 🧠: **The Cognitive Agent**. The user-facing AI that utilizes GNNs and Semantic Synthesis for cognitive augmentation and personalized information simplification.
* **DAWNSTAR** ✨: **The Mobility Agent**. A secure, ROS-compatible module for robotics assistance (e.g., smart wheelchairs), integrating functional safety and embedded NIS2/ISO/SBOM compliance.

### Guaranteed Compliance and Auditability

Our projects integrate European and international standards from the very beginning: the **AI Act**, **NIS2 Directive**, and **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)** are central to our engineering.

## 🧠 The Deep Tech Vision: AI and Robotics for Daily Life

Our approach goes beyond simple interfaces:

* **Cognitive Augmentation:** **Skald** utilizes Deep Tech (GNN, SLM) to transform complex information into **personalized semantic synthesis**, making critical information instantly accessible.
* **Assistance Robotics:** **DAWNSTAR** and **Hearthfire** form the sovereign platform guaranteeing the physical and digital security of users relying on robotic wheelchairs and other autonomy systems.

## 🛠️ Status and Next Steps

This repository is currently utilized for **internal engineering and initial development** of the **Winterhold** architecture.

* We will release the core code (including **Hearthfire**, **MASAQ**, **Ysgrammor**, and **DAWNSTAR**) as they reach an auditable maturity level.
* **Stay Updated:** Follow this repository for official announcements regarding the opening of our projects to community audit.

## 💼 Commercial Licensing (Winterhold)

**Startups, SMEs, and forward-thinking institutions** interested in licensing the full **Winterhold** platform are invited to contact us. This guarantees support, full NIS2 compliance, PQC updates, and access to the entire fine-tuned AI ecosystem.

# IA_AUT_ECO: The Fabless Architecture for Augmented Autonomy

**"Let's be Useful."**

IA_AUT_ECO is a French Deep Tech company dedicated to redefining assistive technology. We operate on a **Fabless model**: we design the sovereign architecture, the secure software, and the hardware standards, while certifying partners for manufacturing.

Our mission is to build the **Winterhold Ecosystem**: a secure, open-source, and ethical foundation for the autonomy of disabled and invalid persons. We provide the "Brain" and the "Nervous System" for the next generation of assistive robotics.

## The Winterhold Framework: Sovereignty & Security

Winterhold is not just software; it is a comprehensive architecture designed for **Zero Trust (ZTA)** environments, **NIS2** compliance, and **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** readiness.

### 1. Hearthfire (The Hardened OS)
The foundation of our security. A minimalist, hardened **FreeBSD Fork** compatible with **OCI (Open Container Initiative)** standards.
* **Role:** Provides a secure, deterministic environment for embedded AI and real-time control.
* **Security:** Implements kernel-level PQC encryption and strict process isolation.

### 2. MASAQ & Skald (The AI Core)
* **MASAQ:** The secure orchestration engine that manages Deep Learning models on Edge devices (NVIDIA Jetson).
* **Skald:** The Cognitive Agent. It uses Small Language Models (SLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to transform complex data into simple, actionable intentions.

### 3. Ysgrammor (The Ethical Audit)
A real-time observability system based on OpenTelemetry. It records the "Proof of Intent" for every AI decision, ensuring full auditability for medical and legal compliance.

### 4. Delphine (The Sovereign Data Core)
An on-premise, ethical CRM and polyglot database designed to manage critical social and medical data without relying on public clouds.

## The Robotic Agents: Dawnstar & Esbern

We provide the certified designs and software stacks for two complementary hardware agents.

### DAWNSTAR: The Safe Mobility Agent
A set of **ROS 2** packages and hardware standards for robotic wheelchairs.
* **Focus:** Critical safety, slope calculation, speed limiting, and semantic navigation.
* **Tech:** Uses PyTorch for vision and scikit-learn for anomaly detection.

### ESBERN: The Robotic Companion

A mobile manipulator agent (robotic arm) that works in synergy with Dawnstar.
* **Focus:** Fine manipulation (grasping, door opening) and environment interaction.
* **Hardware:** Powered by NVIDIA Jetson for heavy edge computing.

## Companion Software Suite: Holistic Cognitive Assurance

Beyond simple navigation, the Esbern/Dawnstar system runs a suite of "Holistic Modules" designed to act as a cognitive prosthesis for conditions like Alzheimer's, Autism, or heavy disability.

* **MNEMOSYNE (Memory):** A local RAG system that records and indexes daily life to answer queries like "Where did I put my glasses?" or "Who visited yesterday?".
* **VESTA (Routine):** Proactive ADL (Activities of Daily Living) monitoring. Detects degradation in habits (hydration, sleep) and alerts before a crisis occurs.
* **KAIROS (Reality):** Manages confusion and "sundowning" phases using validation therapy techniques and environmental adaptation (lighting/music).
* **HERMES (Social):** A real-time social decoder for aphasia and autism, whispering context about interlocutors and predicting sentence completion.
* **HYGIE (Pharma):** High-precision visual identification of medication intake and passive biometric monitoring to ensure compliance and safety.

## Dragonborn: Universal Access (Mobile Demo)

**Dragonborn** is our mass-market demonstration of the Skald Cognitive Agent.
* **Platform:** Android (Kotlin) / iOS.
* **Tech:** Runs optimized **TFLite** models via a **Go** backend.
* **Function:** Translates the visual world into simple semantic instructions and audio, proving that powerful AI can be accessible on standard smartphones without the full Winterhold stack.

## The Fabless Business Model

IA_AUT_ECO focuses on high-value engineering and certification.

1.  **Open Design:** We release 3D blueprints (STEP/CAD), electrical schematics, and core software components to the community.
2.  **Winterhold Certification:** We license the **Winterhold** brand and commercial software support to manufacturing partners who pass our rigorous **DAWNSTAR-QC** testing suite and adhere to our component standards (NVIDIA Jetson, specific IMUs, ISO-compliant materials).

## Status

**Current Phase:** Internal Engineering & Architecture Hardening.
* Validating Hearthfire kernel modifications.
* Training Skald/Mnemosyne models on NVIDIA Jetson.
* Developing the Dragonborn mobile prototype.

## Contact & Licensing

For partnerships, Fabless certification inquiries, or institutional licensing of the Winterhold framework (Municipalities, NGOs), please contact the IA_AUT_ECO team.

**Secure. Sovereign. Useful.**

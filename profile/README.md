## Hi there 👋



# 🇫🇷 IA\_AUT\_ECO: The Augmented Autonomy Architecture (Open Source Deep Tech)

**IA\_AUT\_ECO** is a Deep Tech startup based near Paris, France, dedicated to redefining the use of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Robotics**. Our mission is to build robust, open-source solutions for the daily lives and autonomy of **disabled and invalid persons**.

We are building systems that guarantee **digital sovereignty**, **social inclusion**, and **uncompromising security**.

## 💡 Our Commitment: Open Source for All, Especially Those in Need

We are firm believers that the most critical assistance technologies (AI, Robotics) must be **auditable and enduring**. Our architecture is designed on an ethical **Open Core** model, where the technical foundations will eventually be made public to guarantee full trust and accountability.

* **The Core is Under Development:** Our open-source systems are currently in the initial design and hardening phase. We plan to open up the foundational repositories for community auditing and contributions at a later date.

## 🛡️ Uncompromising Security: A Sovereign Digital Shield

Trust is our currency. Our cybersecurity solutions are integrated by design, exceeding regulatory requirements.

### The Dual OS Architecture (Based on a FreeBSD Fork)

We are developing two distinct operating systems, forked from FreeBSD for its renowned stability and security, to address different levels of criticality:

1.  **Hearthfire (Community & Autonomy Edition):** Our future hardened OS, optimized for local execution, robotics, and assistance systems. It will be Open Source, minimalist, and focused on performance and resilience for the common good.
2.  **Winterhold (Institutional & Enterprise Edition):** Our commercial, ultra-secure operating system, intended for **startups, forward-thinking institutions**, and entities handling sensitive data. It integrates advanced security mechanisms (PQC, ZTA) and full support for regulatory compliance.

### Guaranteed Compliance and Auditability

* **AI Act:** Our AI Agents are being designed to meet future EU AI Act requirements, including rigorous risk classification and integrated ethical auditing mechanisms (**Ysgrammor**).
* **NIS2:** The NIS2 Directive is integrated into the core of our development and deployment processes, ensuring maximum cyber-resilience.
* **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials):** We will provide a comprehensive SBOM for every critical component, ensuring total transparency across our software supply chain.

## 🧠 The Deep Tech Vision: AI and Robotics for Daily Life

Our approach goes beyond simple voice interfaces:

* **Cognitive Augmentation (Skald Agent):** We utilize **Knowledge Graphs** and **Small LLMs (SLMs)** to transform complex information into **personalized semantic synthesis**, making critical information instantly accessible and actionable.
* **Robotics and Drones:** Integration of our AI Agents with robotic platforms and drone systems to extend users' physical autonomy, all securely managed by the **Hearthfire** OS.

## 🛠️ Status and Next Steps

This repository is currently utilized for **internal engineering and initial development**.

We will release the core code for **Hearthfire**, **MASAQ**, and **Ysgrammor** as they reach an auditable maturity level.

* **Stay Updated:** Follow this repository for official announcements regarding the opening of our projects to the community audit.
* **Commercial Interest:** **Startups, SMEs, and institutions** interested in licensing the full **Winterhold** platform for guaranteed support, NIS2 compliance, and access to fine-tuned AI are invited to contact us.

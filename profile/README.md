# 🇫🇷 IA\_AUT\_ECO: The Augmented Autonomy Architecture (Open Source Deep Tech)

**IA\_AUT\_ECO** is a Deep Tech startup based near Paris, France, dedicated to redefining the use of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Robotics**. Our mission is to build robust, open-source solutions for the daily lives and autonomy of **disabled and invalid persons**.

We are building systems that guarantee **digital sovereignty**, **social inclusion**, and **uncompromising security**.

---

##  Our Commitment: Open Source for All

We are firm believers that the most critical assistance technologies (AI, Robotics) must be **auditable and enduring**. Our architecture is designed on an ethical **Open Core** model: the technical foundations will eventually be made public to guarantee full trust and accountability.

* **The Core is Under Development:** Our open-source systems are currently in the initial design and hardening phase. We plan to open up the foundational repositories for community auditing and contributions at a later date.

##  Uncompromising Security: A Sovereign Digital Shield

Trust is our currency. Our cybersecurity solutions are integrated by design, exceeding regulatory requirements.

### The Winterhold Foundational Architecture

The **Winterhold** ecosystem is our comprehensive offering, built upon several critical components, all currently under active development:

* **Hearthfire** : **The Hardened Security OS**. A core operating system (forked from FreeBSD) for local deployment and robotics, emphasizing **Security by Design**, **Zéro Trust (ZTA)**, and **PQC Readiness**.
* **MASAQ**      : **The AI Orchestrator**. Manages the secure and auditable execution of Deep Learning models. Focuses on SLM optimization and Knowledge Graph management.
* **Ysgrammor**  : **The Ethical Audit System**. Provides complete observability (**OpenTelemetry**) for all system actions and AI decisions, delivering **Proof of Intent** and ensuring **NIS2** compliance.
* **Skald**      : **The Cognitive Agent**. User-facing AI for simplification and cognitive augmentation (GNN, Semantic Synthesis).
* **DAWNSTAR**   : **The Safe Mobility Agent**. A **ROS 2** module for the robotic wheelchair base, ensuring **NIS2/ISO/SBOM** compliant control and navigation.
* **ESBERN**     : **The Augmented Robotic Agent (Companion)**. The robotic assistant that handles fine manipulation and interaction, working in synergy with **DAWNSTAR** on the **NVIDIA Jetson** platform.
* **DRAGONBORN**   : is the demonstration application for the **SKALD Cognitive Agent**, designed to showcase the transformative power of Deep Learning in providing real-time sensory and cognitive assistance.

Deployed across mobile platforms using TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), **DRAGONBORN** transcends simple object recognition. It translates the complexity of the visual world into simple, actionable semantic instructions and synthesized audio.

This application is our "proof of concept" to the world: a powerful, accessible, and ethical use of AI that requires minimal technical overhead.

### Guaranteed Compliance and Auditability

Our projects integrate European and international standards from the very beginning: the **AI Act**, **NIS2 Directive**, and **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)** are central to our engineering.

##  The Deep Tech Vision: AI and Robotics for Daily Life

Our approach goes beyond simple interfaces:

* **Cognitive Augmentation:** **Skald** utilizes Deep Tech to transform complex information into **personalized semantic synthesis**, making critical information instantly accessible.
* **Robotic Autonomy:** The **DAWNSTAR** and **ESBERN** system creates a cohesive, sovereign platform, guaranteeing the physical and digital security of users relying on advanced robotic assistance.

##  Status and Next Steps

This repository is currently utilized for **internal engineering and initial development** of the **Winterhold** architecture.

* We will release the core code (including **Hearthfire**, **MASAQ**, **Ysgrammor**, **DAWNSTAR**, and **ESBERN**) as they reach an auditable maturity level.
* **Stay Updated:** Follow this repository for official announcements regarding the opening of our projects to community audit.

##  Commercial Licensing (Winterhold)

**Startups, SMEs, and forward-thinking institutions** interested in licensing the full **Winterhold** platform are invited to contact us. This guarantees support, full NIS2 compliance, PQC updates, and access to the entire fine-tuned AI ecosystem.
